/******************************************************************************

  Summary:
    Initialize the clock calendar driver.

  Description:
    This function configured the basics of a software driven RTCC peripheral.
    It relies upon a periodic TMR1 event to provide time keeping.
    The Timer 1 clock provides a steady 100kHz time base.
    0x8000 counts in the TMR1 register will provide a 1HZ tick.
    CLOCKS_PER_SEC is configured for 1 and all is well.
 
  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    None

  Returns:
    None

  Remarks:
    The C stdlib functions understand UNIX time but they need a UNIX time counter.
    UNIX time is the number of seconds elapsed since Midnight Jan 1, 1970

  Function:
    void rtcc_handler(void) (TMR1 version)

  Summary:
    maintain deviceTime (seconds) using the LCDIF flag/interrupt.

  Description:
    This function decrements seconds_counter until 0 and then increments deviceTime.
    seconds_counter reloads with CLOCK_PER_SEC.
    This version of the function uses Timer 1 as the time base.
    Timer 1 is reloaded with 0x8000 to cause TMR1IF to overflow every second.
 
  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    None

  Returns:
    None

  Remarks:
    TMR1IF is not looked at or modified because there could be other tasks running
    on this interrupt.
